### Survivorship Bias

A potential limitation of this analysis is the presence of survivorship bias.  
Since the dataset only includes companies that were still listed on NASDAQ in 2020, firms that went bankrupt, were delisted, or merged before that date are not represented.  
This limitation may lead to an overestimation of market and especially small-cap performance, as only the firms that survived are observed.  
To mitigate this effect, the study compares results with sectoral and global ETFs, which continuously rebalance and thus account for firm entry and exit over time.  
Additional robustness checks, such as segmenting firms by market capitalization or restricting the analysis to shorter time windows, further help to reduce the influence of this bias.
